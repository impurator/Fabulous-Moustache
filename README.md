# Fabulous Moustache

Fabulous Moustache, hereafter referred to as FABSTACHE, is a basic implementation of a Reactive Documents model, editor, and viewer.
Reactive Documents are credited to Bret Victor, outlined here: ( http://worrydream.com/#!/ExplorableExplanations ).  They're pretty neat, like most of the things he designs.

I've wanted my own reactive document system for a while, and am particularly interested in some form of editor to make them accessible to people who are terrified of code.

The reader is currently deprecated in favor of exporting to HTML/Tangle.  I just have to, you know, implement the export.

If you want a more full-featured system, available as a javascript library, check out Bret's own Tangle here : http://worrydream.com/Tangle/download.html
